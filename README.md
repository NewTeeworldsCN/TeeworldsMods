CK - (JDC110 FHKC1010 JH10 JEL111)
=========

The beginning of the story
--------------------------

Two years ago, Ninecloud2077 and I created a mod called CK, inspired 
from the Battle mod. At that time, I was still young and had poor coding 
skills, so I wrote a bunch of shit. Now, I want to rewrite it and continue 
updating it. By the way, I still don't know what is CK mean, I use 
this name because I don't know how to name, so I type randomly on my 
keyboard.
I think CK can be anything, such as memories of the past or a desire for
the future..
To our thirst for the future.
